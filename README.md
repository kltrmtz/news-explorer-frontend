# News Explorer: Front End

This is the front-end project creating a server for the News Explorer application.

Features
The website should have two main features:

When the user enters a keyword in the search bar, the website will send a request to the News API service, find all the relevant articles over the last week, and display a list of cards for each of them.
It will display all articles a user saves in a special section of the website.

The front end of the website consists of two pages:

The main page with a search box
The page with saved news items where all the liked materials are displayed

Infrastructure
You'll also need to configure two more tools: Git and Create React App.

You'll use Git to store your project in a public repository.

As for the Create React App, it'll help you to create a template in which you'll write the front end for your React project.
